## 🖼️ Architecture Diagrams 

### 1. **Overall System Architecture**

```
+------------------+        HTTP POST         +---------------------+
|                  |   /v1/chat endpoint      |                     |
|     Frontend     +------------------------->+      Backend        |
| (User Interface) |                         |  (FastAPI API)      |
+------------------+                         +----------+----------+
                                                       |
                                                       |  LLM API Call
                                                       v
                                            +----------+----------+
                                            |                     |
                                            |    LLM Provider     |
                                            |  (Third-Party API)  |
                                            +---------------------+
```

### 2. **Backend Agent Graph Logic**

```
       +---------+      (1) User Query      +-------------------+
       |         |------------------------->|                   |
       |  START  |                         |   Assistant Node   |
       |         |                         | (LLM w/Tools)      |
       +---------+                         +---------+---------+
                                                     |
                                                     | (2) Needs Tool?
                                                     v
                                         +-----------+-----------+
                                         |                       |
                                         |      Tools Node       |
                                         | (Math, Search, etc.)  |
                                         +-----------+-----------+
                                                     |
                                                     | (3) Tool Result
                                                     v
                                         +-----------------------+
                                         |   Back to Assistant   |
                                         +-----------------------+
```

*Loop continues until LLM determines no more tools are needed, then final answer is returned.*

### 3. **Frontend–Backend–LLM Provider Communication**

```
   [User]            [Frontend]         [Backend]          [LLM Provider]
     |                  |                  |                     |
     | 1. Type query    |                  |                     |
     +----------------->|                  |                     |
     |                  | 2. POST /v1/chat |                     |
     |                  +----------------->|                     |
     |                  |                  | 3. LLM API Request  |
     |                  |                  +-------------------->|
     |                  |                  |                     |
     |                  |                  | 4. LLM Response     |
     |                  |                  <--------------------+|
     |                  | 5. API Response  |                     |
     |                  <------------------+                     |
     | 6. Show answer   |                                         |
     <------------------+                                         |
```

## ⚖️ Advantages & Drawbacks

### ✅ **Advantages**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Frontend, backend, and LLM provider responsibilities are clearly separated, making the system maintainable and extendable.
- **Extensible Tooling:** Agent can use math and search tools, enabling live, factual, and multi-step reasoning.
- **Modern Python Stack:** Uses FastAPI for async, high-performance APIs and modularity.
- **Easy to Swap LLM Providers:** Backend logic is LLM-agnostic—swap providers with minimal changes.
- **Production-Ready:** Error handling, environment variable support, and scalable architecture.

---

### ❌ **Drawbacks**

- **Latency:** Each user message requires 2+ network hops (frontend → backend → LLM provider → backend → frontend), increasing response time.
- **LLM Token Limits:** Full conversation context is sent on every request, which may hit LLM API token limits for long chats.
- **Third-Party Dependency:** System availability and performance depend on the external LLM API.
- **Cost Control:** Each API call may incur cost, especially with rich tool usage and large contexts.
- **State Management:** True chat state is maintained in frontend (or must be persisted in backend/db for multi-user support).
